> Guardian Grove is a family-focused website designed to strengthen connections between family members through technology. In a world where technology often creates distance, we believe it can also bring families closer together when used intentionally.
>
>Our philosophy is rooted in trust, communication, and growth. By offering interactive features and AI-driven insights, Guardian Grove empowers parents to guide their child's development while fostering meaningful engagement and well-being. Technology, when designed with empathy, should enrich family relationships, not diminish them.

###  Guardian Grove is built using the following technologies:

- This project is developed using the [React](https://react.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) frameworks. React enables a dynamic and responsive user interface, while TypeScript ensures strong typing for more robust and maintainable code.

- For state management, the app leverages [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), streamlining global state management and making complex state interactions easier to handle.
- User authentication and secure backend interactions are implemented using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), all written in TypeScript. This ensures a fast, lightweight, and type-safe API for handling user data and custom AI interactions.
- The app’s AI assistant is powered by [OpenAI's API](https://platform.openai.com/docs), enabling intelligent, context-aware conversations and personalized goal-setting for children and parents.
- For database and persistent storage, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is used to manage data efficiently and reliably.
- Image, videos, audios uploads are handled through [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), allowing seamless media management and transformation.
- The app uses ["Comic Neue"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comic+Neue) as its primary font, giving the design a friendly and approachable feel, while aligning with child-friendly aesthetics.
- Styling is achieved using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for efficient, modern, and responsive design
